 <p id="indexParagraph"> Hello, my name is Oussama, i am from Casablanca, Morocco. i came to the unites states 10 years ago with big dreams, but reality slowly sat in. <br>I spent a few years moving from state to state to find the best fit for me, but then decided that this city was my best bet if i wanted to work and still have time to go back to school. And i have to say it was the best decision i made, even though it was a little bit late, but i have learned valuable lessons along the way.</p>
